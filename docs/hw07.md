# Week9: Discretization

## What to do

Find the code `eg.bins` in mylo.lua that  generates OUTPUT1 and OUTPUT2 (shown below).

Port that code to Python so you can generate it.

## Notes

Rules are combinations of interesting ranges
-  Given N ranges, there are $2^N$ possible
rules. 
- So we're going to have to do something to reduce the space of ranges we use
before we build the rules.

## Finding interesting ranges


what does interesting mean? Well:

- Suppose RRP has found a best leaf of N examples. Call that _best_.
- Let _rest_ be everything that is not _best_.
- Lets say `rowss` is

```
rowss = {"best": [rows in best],
         "rest": [3\*N of rest, selected at random]
}
```

For auto93, my RRP finds 24 _best_ so I picked  3\*24=72 _rest_. 

Next, for all the numeric columns, divide them into bins of size _(hi - lo)/16_ and count how often
attribute values fall into each of those bins.

Now sort the bins and look for adjacent bins that can be merged

## Merge Rules

- Merge any bin containing less thatn 1/16th of the rows.
- Look at how often the remaining bins appear in _best_ and _rest_.
  - Compute the information content $e$ of each bin _a,b_ and each pair of adjecent bins _ab_.
    - if some range occurs at probability $p_i=f_i/n$
      - $f_i$ is the number of times a range appears in $i \in ${_best,rest_}  
      - $n$ is the fotal number of ranges.
    - $e=- \sum_i p_i\*log(p_i,2)$
  - Merge two ranges if the expected value of the entropy of $a$ and $b$  is less that
    $e_{ab}$.

That creates the following ranges:

``` 
OUTPUT1:

{at: 1, scored: 0, txt: Clndrs, x: {hi: 4, lo: -inf}, y: {HATE: 42, LIKE: 24}}
{at: 1, scored: 0, txt: Clndrs, x: {hi: inf, lo: 4}, y: {HATE: 30}}

{at: 2, scored: 0, txt: Volume, x: {hi: 90, lo: -inf}, y: {HATE: 13, LIKE: 11}}
{at: 2, scored: 0, txt: Volume, x: {hi: 115, lo: 90}, y: {HATE: 16, LIKE: 13}}
{at: 2, scored: 0, txt: Volume, x: {hi: inf, lo: 115}, y: {HATE: 43}}

{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: 77, lo: -inf}, y: {HATE: 46}}
{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: 79, lo: 77}, y: {HATE: 13, LIKE: 2}}
{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: 80, lo: 79}, y: {HATE: 4, LIKE: 9}}
{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: 81, lo: 80}, y: {HATE: 2, LIKE: 7}}
{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: inf, lo: 81}, y: {HATE: 7, LIKE: 6}}

{at: 5, scored: 0, txt: origin, x: {hi: 1, lo: 1}, y: {HATE: 43}}
{at: 5, scored: 0, txt: origin, x: {hi: 2, lo: 2}, y: {HATE: 17}}
{at: 5, scored: 0, txt: origin, x: {hi: 3, lo: 3}, y: {HATE: 12, LIKE: 24}}
```

That is, we have $2+3+5+3=13$ ranges, so we $2^{13}-1=8191$ possible rules-- each of which
we have to test on $24+72=96$ rows.  So lets reduce that search space.

## Pruning Ranges

Those ranges can score and sort and pruned as follows. If a range is found in LIKE of the _best_ rows
and _HATE_ or the _rest_ rows, then score is _LIKE\*LIKE/(LIKE+HATE)_.

Here are the ranges, sorted (ignoring anything with less than 10% of max score). 

```
OUTPUT2

#scores:

0.86	{at: 5, scored: 0, txt: origin, x: {hi: 3, lo: 3}, y: {HATE: 12, LIKE: 24}}
0.63	{at: 1, scored: 0, txt: Clndrs, x: {hi: 4, lo: -inf}, y: {HATE: 42, LIKE: 24}}
0.38	{at: 2, scored: 0, txt: Volume, x: {hi: 115, lo: 90}, y: {HATE: 16, LIKE: 13}}
0.33	{at: 2, scored: 0, txt: Volume, x: {hi: 90, lo: -inf}, y: {HATE: 13, LIKE: 11}}
0.33	{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: 80, lo: 79}, y: {HATE: 4, LIKE: 9}}
0.27	{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: 81, lo: 80}, y: {HATE: 2, LIKE: 7}}
0.18	{at: 4, scored: 0, txt: Model, x: {hi: inf, lo: 81}, y: {HATE: 7, LIKE: 6}}
{HATE: 72, LIKE: 24}
```

Nowe we have 7 ranges which means we only have $2^7-1= 127$ rules to check.
