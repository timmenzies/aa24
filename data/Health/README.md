(Note: dataset25 has been removed due to local corruptions.).

Each of the health datasets contains 11 columns.
The left hand side  columns (MRE, ACC, PRED40) are

- MRE being the Mean Relative Error = _abs(predicted - actual)/actual_.
- ACC being the Standardized Accuracy =  (1 - (MAE[^mae]/MAE_GoodGuess)) x 100
- PRED40 being the count of predictions that were within an MRE of 0.4 divided by the total number of predictions

[^mae]: MAE is the mean absolute error 
 
representing three goals measured when training a random forest model to predict for project health 12 months into the future using the configurations defined in the last 5 columns (N_estimators, criterion, Min_sample_leaves, Min_impurity_decrease, Max_depth) 

For the goal columns we want to **Minimize** MRE and **Maximize** ACC and PRED40
